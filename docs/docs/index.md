Learn how to build AI applications that combine unstructured document knowledge with structured enterprise data using knowledge bases, ontology, and natural language queries. Solution accelerators provide ready-to-deploy templates to get you from idea to working solution quickly, then customize it for your industry use case.

## The Opportunity

Organizations have valuable knowledge spread across documents (PDFs, policies, manuals) and structured systems (databases, data warehouses). By connecting these sources through AI, users can get unified answers from a single conversational interface.

## The Solution

**Foundry IQ** and **Fabric IQ** solve this by enabling an intelligent agent that:

- **Creates knowledge bases** from documents with agentic retrieval (plan, iterate, reflect)
- **Defines business ontology** to understand entities, relationships, and rules
- **Queries data** using natural language over both documents and structured data
- **Combines both** to answer complex business questions

**Prerequisites:** Azure subscription with Contributor access, [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd), [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
