# Solution Accelerators in Action: Foundry IQ + Fabric IQ

**Hands-on Lab to Accelerate AI Solution Creation and Customization**

---

Build **AI applications** that combine **unstructured document knowledge** with **structured enterprise data** — enabling natural language queries across your entire data estate.

## The Opportunity

Organizations have valuable knowledge spread across documents (PDFs, policies, manuals) and structured systems (databases, data warehouses). By connecting these sources through AI, users can get unified answers from a single conversational interface.

## The Solution

This lab demonstrates how **Foundry IQ** and **Fabric IQ** solve this by creating an intelligent agent that:

- **Understands documents** using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Queries structured data** in Microsoft Fabric using natural language
- **Combines both** to answer complex business questions

## What You'll Build

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| AI Agent | Azure AI Foundry | Orchestrates tools and generates responses |
| Document Search | Azure AI Search | Vector + semantic search over documents |
| Data Queries | Fabric IQ | Natural language to SQL over Fabric |
| Evaluation | Azure AI Evaluation | Quality and safety testing |
